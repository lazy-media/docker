# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open an issue**. Instead, email your findings to [your-email@example.com].
2. **Provide detailed information**, including any proof of concept and steps to reproduce the issue.

## Best Security Practices for Docker

1. **Minimize the attack surface** by avoiding unnecessary packages.
2. **Use official and trusted images** like the latest `ubuntu` image.
3. **Keep images up to date** and rebuild them regularly to get the latest patches.
4. **Limit container privileges** by using Docker's security features like user namespaces, seccomp profiles, etc.
5. **Avoid hardcoding secrets** in the Dockerfile or source code.
